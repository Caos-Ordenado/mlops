# Agent Development Rules
## General
- All agents must use the shared logging system (`loguru` via `shared.logging`).
- All agents must use async context managers for service clients (web crawler, Ollama, etc).
- All agents must use the repository pattern for database access (see `database.mdc`).
- All agents must document new features in their respective `README.md`.
- All agents must handle connection and database errors gracefully.
- All agents must use environment variables for configuration, not hardcoded values.
- All agents must follow the cache strategy and best practices described in `database.mdc`.

## LLM Usage
- Prefer Qwen family for strict JSON outputs: `qwen2.5:7b` for generation/validation; `qwen3:latest` for classification; fallback `gpt-oss:20b`.
- Use `format:"json"` and `temperature: 0.0` for validators/extractors.
- Keep responses minimal; do not emit markdown fences when JSON is expected.

## Example Usage

```python
from shared.logging import setup_logger
logger = setup_logger("my_agent")

from shared.web_crawler_client import WebCrawlerClient
async with WebCrawlerClient() as client:
    ...

from shared.ollama_client import OllamaClient
async with OllamaClient() as llm:
    ...
```
```
