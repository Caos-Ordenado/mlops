# Traefik Configuration Rules

## Core Rules
- Ignore TCP/UDP CRD warnings unless needed
- Use path-based routing instead of NodePorts
- Use latest Traefik middlewares and configurations

## Service Configuration
- HTTP services: Use path-based routing
- TCP services (databases):
  - PostgreSQL: port 5432
  - Redis: port 6379
- No path/prefix needed for TCP services
- No HTTP middlewares for TCP routing
