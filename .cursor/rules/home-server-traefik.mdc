# Special Rules for Traefik
- When you see CRDs problem on traefik logs, ignore them if these are warnings related to TCP or UDP unless we start using them
- Avoid NodePorts entirely, use path based routing to the pods matching ports as expected.
- Use the latest Traefik middlewares and configurations
- Follow Traefik's best practices for ingress routes and middleware configuration
