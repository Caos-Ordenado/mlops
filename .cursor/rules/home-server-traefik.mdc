# Special Rules for Traefik
- When you see CRDs problem on traefik logs, ignore them if these are warnings related to TCP or UDP unless we start using them
- Avoid NodePorts entirely, use path based routing to the pods matching ports as expected.
- Use the latest Traefik middlewares and configurations
- Follow Traefik's best practices for ingress routes and middleware configuration

# TCP Service Exposure
- Database services (PostgreSQL and Redis) are exposed through Traefik's TCP router
- TCP services are configured in the Traefik service configuration:
  - PostgreSQL: Exposed on port 5432
  - Redis: Exposed on port 6379
- Access these services using home.server as the host with their respective ports
- No additional path or prefix is needed for TCP services
- TCP services don't use HTTP middlewares or path-based routing
