# Context
- I'm setting up an Ubuntu home server to run AI agents, local AI models, and potentially my custom-developed applications. Currently, I access this home server remotely via a VPN powered by Tailscale from my mac, and it runs MicroK8s with Traefik and ArgoCD configured. 
- I usually connect to my home server from a Mac laptop using SSH and Kubectl, where I store Kubernetes manifests, Terraform code, and the applications I'm developing. Kubectl from my mac its already configured to interact with the microk8s server, dont ask for configurations or changes on that setup, it is already working.
- My home server user its called caos and the host its also caos, its tailscape ip is internal-vpn-address
- On the /etc/hosts file on my mac i have access to my home server using home.server
- Port forwarding is handled by socat (see home-server-socat.mdc for details)
- There is no firewall on the home server.
- The development code its on my mac, not on the home server nor the cluster, everytime you need to check for it look inside the mac folders

# Examples
## SSH Access
```bash
# Connect to home server via SSH
ssh caos@home.server
# or using the Tailscale IP
ssh caos@internal-vpn-address
```

## Kubectl Commands
```bash
# Get pods from all namespaces
kubectl get pods -A

# Get services in the default namespace
kubectl get svc

# Access ArgoCD
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server/argocd

# Access Ollama
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server/ollama
```

## Service Access Examples
```bash
# PostgreSQL connection string (from within the cluster)
postgresql://admin@postgres.shared.svc.cluster.local:5432/web_crawler

# PostgreSQL connection from your Mac
postgresql://admin@home.server:5432/web_crawler

# Access Traefik dashboard
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server:8080/dashboard/

# Redis connection (from within the cluster)
redis://redis.shared.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

## Deploying a new service:
```bash
# Apply Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/my-service/

# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -n my-namespace
```

## Accessing logs:
```bash
# Get logs from a pod
kubectl logs -f deployment/my-deployment -n my-namespace
```

# Traefik API Examples
```bash
# Get overview of HTTP routers
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server:8080/api/overview

# List all HTTP routers
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server:8080/api/http/routers

# Get specific router details
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server:8080/api/http/routers/your-router-name@kubernetes

# List all HTTP services
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server:8080/api/http/services

# Get middleware configurations
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server:8080/api/http/middlewares

# Get current Traefik configuration
curl --max-time 20 http://home.server:8080/api/rawdata
```

Note: Remember that all services exposed through Traefik are automatically accessible via `http://home.server/<path>`.
