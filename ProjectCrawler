## **Project Prompt: Supermarket Price Comparison AI Agent**

### **Objective**
Develop an adaptive AI-powered agent integrated with an existing, multi-level depth web crawler to intelligently search, analyze, and identify the best (lowest) prices for products across multiple websites.
The AI agent will dynamically control crawler depth, utilize advanced semantic analysis with Llama 3 LLM (8B), and leverage data already stored in Redis and PostgreSQL.

### **Current Environment**
- **Hardware:**
  - NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU (12 GB VRAM)
  - Intel Core i9-13900K CPU
  - 32 GB RAM

- **Software Infrastructure:**
  - Ollama for hosting local LLMs
  - Redis (shared instance for caching/realtime storage)
  - PostgreSQL (persistent storage for crawled data)

### **Selected AI Model**
- **Llama 3 (8B model):**
  - Reasonable balance between performance and hardware resources
  - Local execution via Ollama:
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3
  ollama run llama3
  ```

### **Project Steps & Requirements**

#### **Step 1: Adaptive Web Search Integration**
 - Develop a DuckDuckGo Search Tool:
   - Accept natural language queries from the agent.
   - Provide relevant URLs for initial scraping (approximately 10 initial results).

#### **Step 2: Data Processing and Cleaning**
- Use the LLM to process and standardize raw data, addressing issues such as:
  - Normalization of product names.
  - Extraction of numerical price values.
  - Removal or correction of incomplete or inconsistent records.

#### **Step 3: Comparative Analysis**
- Implement logic within the LLM's inference layer to:
  - Identify matching products across different supermarkets, even when naming conventions differ.
  - Calculate the best price per item across all available supermarket data.
  - Optionally, track historical price trends and highlight significant price drops or spikes.

#### **Step 4: Output and Results Presentation**
- Generate clear, structured summaries and recommendations using the LLM, presenting data such as:
  - Best current prices per product.
  - Historical pricing insights.
  - Supermarket-specific price comparison reports.

#### **Step 5: User Interface Integration (Optional but Recommended)**
- Provide data outputs via a RESTful API (FastAPI recommended) or export structured JSON, enabling further integration with front-end or mobile applications.

#### **Step 6: Automation and Scheduling**
- Schedule regular data processing runs (e.g., hourly or daily) to continuously update and present accurate, timely price comparisons.

#### **Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance**
- Set up monitoring for LLM inference performance, resource utilization, and data quality.
- Define maintenance workflows for regular model updates, database optimization, and incremental training or fine-tuning if necessary.

#### **Step 8: Ethical and Compliance Considerations**
- Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).
- Verify data integrity and security throughout the processing pipeline.

- Comprehensive documentation on:
  - Model integration and database querying.
  - Data standardization methods.
  - Deployment and maintenance procedures.
